This source code is a requirment of my assignment in data struct. subject. This work has been done in a group team,
but mainly I compiled and combined it together to make it one program. I also got help from seniors and friends to
make our program appears in this form. The assignment guidelines:

Implement a linked list ADT to perform any 4 types of sorting algorithms on 3 different size of numerical
datasets (20, 200, and 2000). The numerical datasets should be randomly generated. Compare all 4 sorting
algorithms on different size of numerical datasets and determine which has a better performance on the
datasets.
